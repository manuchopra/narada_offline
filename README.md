A simple app to securely request and deliver datagrams for the non-internet enabled and illiterate

800 million Indians don't have access to the internet, but a large proportion of them still have phones. We wanted to give an internet messaging experience to those who are not lucky enough to have expensive data plans.
Our product enables a user to create messages or request internet web pages, then "give" these requests to another user over bluetooth. The second user can then travel to an internet zone and fetch the datagrams for the first user.
